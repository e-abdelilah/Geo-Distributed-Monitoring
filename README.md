An observability and monitoring setup was designed and deployed to track file data popularity, cache efficiency, request latency, and infrastructure resource usage across Geo-distributed regions. It uses AWS S3 for global data storage and Redis for regional caching to optimize performance. Prometheus collects metrics such as file access frequency, cache hits and misses, and server utilization, while Grafana dashboards provide clear insights into system behavior and performance trends. Tracked files are displayed through a simple Public Health & Wellness Resources web interface, combining backend monitoring with user-friendly data visualization.
